*** Central Train Control Office


**** Trains
***** Routing
A dispatcher should be able to create a route of a train.
****** Validity checks on inputs
****** Exact sequence of operations
A dispatcher will press the button "Dispatch Train" and it will propagate a pop up window where he/she can select a line, speed and authority.
This will then dispatch a train from the yard.
****** Responses to abnormal situations
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilities
Need info from wayside about blocks in order to maintain a fixed block type of schedule.
****** Error handling and recovery
Deny a train from being dispatched if block it is entering is not free.
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to input
A dispatcher inputs line, speed and authority for a train to then leave the yard.
****** Input/Output sequences
****** Formulas for input to output conversion


***** Scheduling
 A dispatcher should be able to choose the type of schedule, automatic and manual, MBO and fixed block. 
****** Validity checks on inputs
****** Exact sequence of operations
A dispatcher will choose will either choose Automatic or Manual mode for the schedule.
If Automatic is chosen, then dispatcher can choose between MBO and Fixed Block modes. 
If Manual is chosen, then dispatcher is responsible for manually dispatching trains from the yard.
****** Responses to abnormal situations
If communication between MBO and CTC is severed, then the dispatcher will then be notified to dispatch trains via manual mode.
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilitates
The actual schedule is received from the MBO.
****** Error handling and recovery
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
Depending on the mode of schedule input by the dispatcher, it will affect how trains are being directed around the track.
****** Input/Output sequences
****** Formulas for input to output conversion


***** Monitoring
The office should monitor current block statuses as well as the speed and authority of any train on the track.
****** Validity checks on inputs
****** Exact sequence of operations
There are two separate sections which will display either information about a chosen block or a chosen train per the dispatchers choices in the interface.
****** Responses to abnormal situations
If communication between the CTC and wayside controller is severed, trains may operate as usual as they can still obtain a schedule or operate in manual mode on their own. However, the CTC will not be able to see any info about the blocks/trains.
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilities
All track/block information as well as the speed/authority/GPS location of trains comes from the wayside controller.
****** Error handling and recovery
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
A dispatcher will enter either a specific line/segment/block or train and then receive information corresponding to that piece.
****** Input/Output sequences
****** Formulas for input to output conversion


**** Track Segment
***** Open/Close Tracks
The dispatcher should be able to close a block for maintenance, as well as dispatch maintenance to a certain block.
****** Validity checks on inputs
****** Exact sequence of operations
The dispatcher will be alerted to a failure via the far left color-changing block. In the track section of the interface, a dispatcher can select a line/segment/block. Then he/she can select the "Close Track" button followed by the "Send Maintenance" button. Sending maintenance will fix the block and automatically reopen the block.
****** Responses to abnormal situations
Should a failure occur, the dispatcher will close and repair a block.
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilities
The wayside controller will be communicating track failures to the CTC.
****** Error handling and recovery
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
When a dispatcher sends out maintenance/closes a block, then trains will not be allowed to enter this block until it is fixed. 
****** Input/Output sequences
****** Formulas for input to output conversion


**** Authority/Speed
The office can determine each train's authority/speed.
***** Validity checks on inputs
***** Exact sequence of operations
In the train portion of the interface, a dispatcher can select the "Authority" button or "Speed" button which will propagate a pop up window. In this window, a dispatcher can input the authority in feet, as well as check which train they are assigning this authority to.
***** Responses to abnormal situations
***** Overflow
***** Communication facilities
The authority is sent from the CTC to the wayside controller.
***** Error handling and recovery
***** Effect of parameters
***** Relationship of output to inputs
This indirectly effects the trains speed/authority. The CTC communicates with the wayside who in turn communicates with other members of the communication path.
***** Input/Output sequences
***** Formulas for input to output conversion


**** System Display
The office should display information about the entire transit system. Including: train speed/authority, track block status, throughput, switch direction, railway crossing status, light status, track/train failures.
***** Validity checks on inputs
***** Exact sequence of operations
Upon selecting a certain block or train, information from the wayside controller will be displayed.
***** Responses to abnormal situations
***** Overflow
***** Communication facilities
The wayside controller provides the CTC with this information.
***** Error handling and recovery
***** Effect of parameters
***** Relationship of output to inputs
***** Input/Output sequences
***** Formulas for input to output conversion


**** Communication
***** Inputs

******* Checks to do
******* Used for?
Given to wayside controller to then communicate to trains. Given to MBO to decide which kind of schedule is being run.

****** Close Track/Send Maintenance
******* To where?
Wayside controller
******* Checks to do
******* Used for?
Shutting down a block of track so that trains cannot travel on it.

****** Speed/Authority
******* To where?
Wayside Controller
******* Checks to do
******* Used for?
Giving a suggestion of speed and authority to wayside to communicate to trains.

****** Dispatch Train (when in manual)
******* To where?
Wayside Controller
******* Checks to do
******* Used for?
When in manual mode, and acting outside of a schedule, the dispatcher can dispatch trains from the yard.
