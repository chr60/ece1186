****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
****** Input/Output sequences
****** Formulas for input to output conversion
Units shown will be calculated in metric as given/supplied and converted to imperial for display.

***** Track Model Display
A list of blocks, selectable by line and segment, will be display with relevant information.

**** Control
***** PLC
The user will be able to load in a PLC program, supplying a file path or browsing for the file.
****** Validity checks on inputs
File not found or does not exist.
PLC file contains errors or is not valid.
****** Exact sequence of operations
User loads in file, and once loaded, PLC unit controls state of track using boolean logic to determine signals to send to track model components.
****** Responses to abnormal situations
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilities
****** Error handling and recovery
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
Outputs will vary on inputs from the CTC and Track Model.
****** Input/Output sequences
PLC unit will take in speed/authority suggestions from CTC, as well as block occupancy and associated block information (lights, crossings, etc) from track model.
****** Formulas for input to output conversion
Units shown will be calculated in metric as given/supplied and converted to imperial for display.

***** Testing
A test console will be available for the user to simulate (for testing/debugging purposes) inputs coming into the wayside unit to observe its behavior.
****** Validity checks on inputs
****** Exact sequence of operations
User opens test console, fixes desired track & train info, and clicks "OK" to give wayside specified information.
****** Responses to abnormal situations
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilities
****** Error handling and recovery
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
****** Input/Output sequences

****** Track State Manipulations
******* To where?
Track Model
******* Checks to do
PLC code will determine outputs to change state of track.
******* Used for?
Sending signals to track model in order to change the direction of a switch, turn on or off a light, activate/deactivate a railroad crossing, set speed/authority for a train.
