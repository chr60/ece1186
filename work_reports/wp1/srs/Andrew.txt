**** Safety
***** Speed Limit
The train should be stopped from exceeding the speed limit.
****** Validity checks on inputs
If the train is over the accepted speed limit of the block or the suggested speed set by the CTC, the train's service brakes will be applied to slow down the train to the correct speed. 
****** Exact sequence of operations
When the user selects the train from the list of dispatched trains, the system will check to make sure the speed of the train is less than that of the suggested speed (automatic mode), or the speed of the train is less than the block speed (manual mode).
This will be done by comparing the speed of te train to the suggested speed and block speed found under the Speed Controller and Block Info sections of the Train Controller. 
****** Responses to abnormal situations
If either the service brakes or the emergency brakes are down on the train, and cannot be applied to slow the train down, the train will continue at the speed it is going until the train slows down naturally.  
****** Overflow
****** Communication facilities
Determining the speed of the train comes from the tachometer on the train.
Determining the block speed and the suggested speed comes from the wayside controller and the CTC, respectively. 
****** Error handling and recovery
****** Effect of parameters
****** Relationship of output to inputs
